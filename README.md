The web application designed is named Daytripper and is a website that allows people to find fun day trips based on their location. Based on the user’s searches, the website will suggest a range of activities, sites of interest, and other such single-day holiday ideas within a user-input distance radius.

The main goal of the Daytripper website is to help users find cafes, bars, restaurants, museums, and art galleries of interest within a specified target range (within a radius), totaling five tabs. Users can select a target range based on their starting point and then click on the search button and the system will display results that meet the filtering criteria.

Users will first need to log in or create an account so that they can leave reviews of places they have visited and personalize the options to suit their needs, which they can do on the initial login page.

Once logged in, the user will be taken to a search page that will display search options such as 'find', 'starting location', and 'search radius' as well as random recommendations of some places the user might like to visit.

On the search results page, the user will see the results of their search, including information such as the name of the day trip, the starting location, and the category. The search results are sorted from most relevant to least relevant.

If they click on a day trip they are interested in, they will be redirected to the details page, where they can see photos, Google and Daytripper users’ reviews, maps, and a short text description. If they wish, they can leave a review and bookmark the location as an option for future trips.
